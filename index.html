      <h3>about me</h3>
      <p>
        What's up! I'm Tarik, an aspiring software developer based out of Miami, interested in learning
        the ins, outs, and limits of modern web/software development. I'm a recent graduate of Hamilton College
        where I majored in Africana Studies and minored in Japanese language. As indicative of my studies, 
        I avidly consume Black urban culture (yes! Hip-hop!), which at various points intersects with my more modest interests
        in Japanese culture. These range from Japanese manga (the likes of Takehiko Inoue's <span>Vagabond</span>)
        to modern Japanese minimalism and urban youth culture. Being a 90s baby of the internet generation, all of my personal interests
        are intimately influenced, and mediated by the web. I work to hone my skills as a developer to not only bring myself among those
        who architect this powerfully mediating force, but to befriend and work alongside individuals who share a passion for creating and 
        authoring content and software that brings people across the world together in the best ways possible.
